x220-statusbar
==============

Status bar (for example for use with spectrwm) for the Thinkpad X220

This is a modified version of a script found originally here:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Spectrwm#Statusbar_configuration

I adapted it to my X220, but could not upload it to the Thinkpad Wiki
because of some technical problems.  So I save it here.  Have fun.
